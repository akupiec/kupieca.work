        <h5>Problem</h5>
        <h2>
          Aphasia, a condition more widespread than various common disorders, lacks public awareness, with 84.5% of
          people unfamiliar with the term.
        </h2>
        <p>
          The project addresses the pressing issue of <span class="bold">societal awareness </span>about secondary
          illiteracy and aphasia, particularly the challenges individuals face in regaining reading abilities after
          brain surgery or strokes,
          <span class="bold"> highlighting the flaws in the prevailing system</span> that often place the responsibility
          for communication the affected person.

        <h2>Increasing societal emphaty by spreading awareness about the issue by quick and cheap print - zine.</h2>

          By addressing the lack of familiarity with aphasia, the project aims to spark conversations and promote a more
          compassionate approach towards those grappling with reading difficulties.

          condition is often mistaken for many other situations. Feelings of social isolation with resulting emotional
          effects are common to individuals with aphasia.
