            <p>
              In my Graphic Design university course, I addressed a long-standing wish of having
              <strong> space for creatives</strong> to design solutions for societal and environmental issues. Within a
              span of <strong> three weeks</strong>, I developed a<strong> comprehensive brand concept</strong>,
              complete with a logo, patterns, and more.

          taking place in society and in the industry itself. Using moderation, inspiration and involvement, they
          <strong>encourage people</strong> to shape their opinions and stimulate them to <strong> take action.</strong>

          signifies vision and insight, reflecting an ethos of not just doing but also understanding. Together, it
          encapsulates a narrative of <strong>taking action in a secure community</strong>, with a keen eye on

        <h5>Stickers & Conversations</h5>
        <h2>How I sparked conversations about sustainable design </h2>
        <p>
          In my commitment to promoting the values of the club and advocating for sustainable design practices, I took
          the initiative to <strong>design and distribute a series of impactful environmental stickers</strong>. These
          were strategically disseminated at notable events such as
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/krakowzinefest" target="_blank" class="links">
            Zine Fest in Krakow
          </a>
          and various other gatherings, including within my university community.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stickers not only served as a visual representation of my dedication to sustainable design but also proved
          to be <strong> effective conversation starters</strong>. Engaging with fellow creatives and enthusiasts, these
          stickers initiated numerous meaningful and inspiring discussions that
          <strong> left a lasting impression</strong>. Through these interactions, I witnessed a shared enthusiasm for
          sustainable practices within the creative community, leaving me genuinely
          <strong>hopeful for the future of design </strong>.

        <h5>Reflections</h5>
        <h2>Looking towards the future </h2>

        <p>
          Throughout my engagement in this branding project, I've gained valuable insights that have
          <strong>shaped my perspective on initiating positive change</strong>. While I acknowledge there are aspects of
          the branding process I'd refine with my newfound knowledge, the overarching reflections emphasize my
          forward-looking approach:

        <div class="noteboxes">
          <h2>Silence breeds stagnation</h2>
          <p>
            Zine Fest became a platform where I discovered a community teeming with passion—
            <strong>a pivotal moment that propelled me forward</strong>. This experience signifies my proactive
            commitment to sparking profound conversations about sustainability. I eagerly anticipate
            <strong>channeling this fervor into every creative endeavor</strong>, contributing to a team that shares a
            vision for transformative industry impact.

          <h2>From dialogue to action</h2>

            Beyond conversations lies the imperative to turn words into tangible change. Identifying a group eager to
            engage in future pro-bono activities has fueled my ambition. To extend our impact,
            <strong> I envision creating a digital space</strong>, possibly on Instagram or Facebook, as a hub for
            collective action—a testament to the power of unity.

            branding, the importance of <strong>a shared goal remains paramount for focus and cohesion</strong>.
