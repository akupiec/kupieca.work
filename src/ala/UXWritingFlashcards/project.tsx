        <p>
          In the journey of creating a project focused on UX writing and design education, three key reflections
          emerged, shaping my understanding and approach to effective communication, integration of design elements, and
          the pivotal role of empathy in educating aspiring designers.
        </p>

        <div className="noteboxes">
          <h2>Effective communication of complex concepts</h2>
          <p>
            I learned to communicate complex UX writing concepts effectively to fellow designers, employing visually
            appealing flash cards and reader-centered principles for accessibility.

        </div>
        <div className="noteboxes">
          <h2>Lasting Impact</h2>
          <p>
            Even after some time since completing this project, the concepts depicted on the flash cards remain vivid in
            my memory. While I may not recall them verbatim, I can intuitively implement these principles when engaged
            in the design process.

          <h2>Empathy in design education</h2>

            Focusing on UX writing addressed the challenge of educating junior UX designers empathetically, prioritizing
            an enjoyable and bold design approach that considers the emotional and motivational aspects of learners.
